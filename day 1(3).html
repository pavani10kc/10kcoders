        <p>Savitri was born on 6 December 1934[a] in a Telugu-speaking family in Chirravuru, Guntur district of present-day Andhra Pradesh. Her parents were Subhadramma and Guravayya and both of them belonged to Kapu caste.[9][10][11][12] Her father died when she was six months old, after which her mother took Savitri and an older sibling, Maruti to live with an aunt and uncle. Her uncle, Kommareddy Venkataramaiah enrolled her in classes when she began to show a talent for dance.

            She was named for the expression of her eyes during dramas. She participated in many dramas, in one where she was rewarded with a garland by the famous actor Prithviraj Kapoor. She, along with her uncle, went to the Vijaya Vauhini studio in Chennai to enroll Savitri as a character in a movie, though they refused to do so. Not giving up, they tried once again, in another cinema, where she managed to get a role, but could not stand it as she hesitated in reciting dialogues because she was in awe when talking to the hero. </p>
